            When first invented, plastic was seen as revolutionary because it
            offered a cheap, durable, hygienic product that could be used for a
            variety of purposes. However, the ever-increasing production would
            cause unforeseen consequences. Especially concerning is what
            plastics are made from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost all single-use plastics are made from fossil fuels. So, the
            carbon footprint of the plastics is vast, by one estimate, emissions
            from producing and incinerating plastics could amount to <b>56 gigatons
            of carbon</b> â€” almost <b>50 times the annual emissions</b> of all of the coal
            power plants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plastic is a complex material which is durable and can be broken
            down easily in order to decompose. But can <b>never completely break
            down</b>, in fact, every <b>piece ever made still exists today</b> in the form
            of smaller and weaker pieces known as microplastics, which are
            smaller than 5mm.
